Bethany’s parents, Boyd and Brooke Green with their daughter Bryn and a dedicated group of supporters have hosted this night since 2006.", "The first few dances from 2006 - 2011 raised money to help fund an addition to Ogeechee Area Hospice, appropriately named, “Bethany’s Place”.  Each year since, the money raised has been donated to families with children who have medical needs.  While each year is a different theme, every year is an opportunity for Daddies to sweep their little girls off their feet and dance the night away."]

While others are here for a very short time and touch many lives even when they are gone. Although you were only with us a few days, your life has brought joy to so many. This year will be the fourteenth year that we have hosted the Father Daughter Date-Night to honor your life and to help a family experiencing the sickness of a child.", "It is so special to see daughters dress up for a special night with dad! This night has raised so much money to help ease the stress for many families over the years. It is amazing how your life has brought so much joy! Although you are not here in body, each year you are here with us in spirit and the night feels like our own special night with you. Thank you for blessing us with your beautiful life and your lasting legacy. We love you sweet girl!"]

Every year since you passed, our family has hosted the Father Daughter Date-Night in your honor. We have chosen a family with a child that is sick and given the proceeds from the night. This is in hopes of helping them as much as we can.", "Because of you and your impact you continue to hold on everyone, daddies take the time one night out of the year to spend with their little girls. To get dressed up with our dad for one night and dance means more to me than anything. Seeing him on the dance floor having a great time is the best thing to see. As much as I miss you and wish you could be here with me, your legacy lives on in the dance. Love you sweet sister!"]
