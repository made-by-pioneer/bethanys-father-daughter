read_more = "MEET MIA (written by Chelsea, Mia's mom) ~ She was born July 24, 2019. Eagerly waiting for her arrival was her big brother Archer, her mother Chelsea and her father Zach. Shortly after birth, Mia was referred for her newborn hearing screening. At 4 weeks old we received the news that Mia was profoundly deaf in both ears. We have decided to go the route of Cochlear Implantation and Speech Therapy. Though this journey isn't what we expected, God has bigger plans for sweet Mia.\n\nMEET CHOICES OF THE HEART (written by Emily, COTH volunteer) ~ Choices of the Heart Pregnancy Resource Center was established in 1987 to \"affirm life by sharing the love of Jesus with those experiencing a pregnancy-related crisis and to provide a network of care before and after the pregnancy.\"\n\nDemonstrating His love to women who are at a pivotal time in their lives, we offer free pregnancy tests, free ultrasounds, and counseling to help them make the best and fully informed decision for themselves and their babies.\n\nPrivately funded, we rely completely on the generosity of donors to provide for our facility, staffing, and equipment needs. As our support has grown, so has our outreach!\n\nCurrently, we are housed in a beautiful facility (425 East Grady Street across from Ogeechee Area Hospice) with a state of the art ultrasound machine, an education room, a counseling room, a spacious waiting area, an office, and a small kitchen. Our storage room contains diapers, clothes, and other baby items we gladly share with our moms.\n\nExecutive Director Allison Waters leads Choices of the Heart along with Laura Shaver, Director of Client Services, Gretchen Beaulieu, R.N., and Sonographer Jane Hodges.\n\nCOTH relies on a team of volunteers who support the ministry in practical ways: facility cleaning, tech support, fundraising efforts, clerical work, lawn maintenance... Their time and talents make our best efforts better.\n\nWhen you support Choices of the Heart, you are, in essence, a lifesaver. A lifesaver to Nia, Abigail, Elijah, Dakaria, Angel, Destiny, Jaylen, Xavier, Antonio, Harper, Ashanti, Gabriela, Francisco.... and many more!"
