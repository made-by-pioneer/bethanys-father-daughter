summary = "Chyann and Jade Hoyle, daughters of Stephen and Rosanna Hoyle, have cystic fibrosis. At first glance, it is difficult to see the effect this disease has played in their lives. Thanks to the great strides the Cystic Fibrosis. Foundation has made, Chyann and Jade lead a very active lifestyle. The medications the girls take and the breathing treatments they do each day help to delay or defer the progress of the disease. The girls need check-ups every three months and sometimes spend ten days at a time in the hospital for treatments and strong antibiotics."

summary = "Our lives were forever changed on the morning of August 8, 2008 when God blessed us with our precious baby girl, Susanna Hayes Polk. We fell in love with her instantly and the joy she has brought to our lives is difficult to describe in words. Just 2 days before she turned 3, Anna Hayes was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, and our lives were changed forever again. She was always an amazing child in our eyes but now she is more than thatâ€”she is our HERO. Anna Hayes has faced this disease head on with her strong-willed personality and is determined to not let this get the best of her!"
